WHY this project was chosen?

I chosen this project because it is a resume where anybody person can see this project and see any details like education, skills and experience.

HOW did you make the project?

I've used HTML to structure the website. CSS to style the website and CSS-GRID to layout the website. This website is created using VS CODE editor. This project doesn't include any database and API's.

WHAT features, technical things you had implemented?

As this project was created just using HTML and CSS there isn't much interaction with user and no dynamic functions are included. The main focus was to style the project properly so it looks like a resume website.
